userName=["Umer","Adil","Rehman"]
for i in userName:
    print(i)
# Looping through String Values
x="Hello"
for i in x:
    print(i)
    print(" ")
# Range Function in For Loops
for i in range(10):

for i in range(0,10):
    print(i)
    print(" ")
# Here value print 4 to 20 but there is addition of 2 in each value .
for i in range(2,10,2):
    print(i)
