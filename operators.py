# Now we use different python operators such as (+,-,*,/)
a=5
b=5
# For Addition we use "+"" operator and we store the value of a & b in c variable
c=a+b
print(c)
#For Subtraction we use "+"" operator and we store the value of a & b in c variable
c=a-b
print(c)
#For Multiplication we use "+"" operator and we store the value of a & b in c variable
c=a*b
print(c)
#For Division  we use "+"" operator and we store the value of a & b in c variable
c=a/b
print(c)
